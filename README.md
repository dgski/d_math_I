# Discrete Mathematics I Concepts Applied

- **Tree**: A standard tree data structure including various traversal and counting methods.
- **Graph**: A simple graph data structure class in which nodes hold a list of allconnections. A demonstration of Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.
- **Graph Properties**: Uses dictionary representation of a Graph. Collection of functions which determine connection status between nodes, the out and in degrees of a given node, reflexivity, transitivity, symmetry, and walk the graph.
- **Weighted Graph**: A simple graph data structure class in which nodes are also weighted. Uses Prims algorithm for the generation of a Minimum Spanning Tree.
- **Matrices**: A collection of functions that operate on matrices. Includes:access columns, matrix multiplication, dot product operations, binary addition, + operation.
- **Relations**: A collection of functions that compose relations given two sets, calculate relation power, and create a transitive closure of a relation.
